**MIL Version** MIL X SP6

**Type** Example

**Description**  
This program shows how to use multiple digitizers to do acquisition and displaying. The main starts an independent processing job for each digitizer (one per camera) and then waits for a key to be pressed to stop them.

The project structure, including the xml, aims to be copied in "\Users\Public\Documents\Matrox Imaging\MIL\Examples\BoardSpecific\MorphisChannelSwitching" of the MIL installation directory to be displayed by the MIL example launcher.
